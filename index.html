  <h4>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why:</h4>
    <p>CMSC 130 is my favorite computer science subject so far because I really enjoyed designing logic circuits and drawing them afterwards.</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>Favorite GE so far and why:</h4>
    <p>ARTS 1 is my favorite GE so far because the lesson topics in that subject were interesting and the lecturer I had was very pleasant. He seemed like he truly loves the arts and the subject he is teaching which encouraged me to further listen to his lectures and actively participate in class activities.</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>Favourite programming languange so far and why:</h4>
    <p>Java and Javascript are my favorites so far. I really enjoyed working with graphics in one of our exercises that we had near the end of the semester.</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>Favorite food:</h4>
    <p>Strawberries, churros, frozen yogurt, cheesecake, honey butter chips and a lot more. I really can't choose one. I like spicy food too.</p>
